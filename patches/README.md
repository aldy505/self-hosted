# Self-Hosted Sentry Patches

Other than the default self-hosted Sentry installation, sometimes users can leverage their existing infrastructure to help them
with limited resources. "Patches", or you might call this like a "plugin system", is a bunch of bash scripts that can be used
to modify the existing configuration to achieve the desired goal.

Beware that this is very experimental and might not work as expected.
Use it at your own risk.
